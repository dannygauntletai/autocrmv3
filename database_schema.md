Below is an iterative approach to the database schema that builds across all six sprints. Each sprint adds or refines tables, fields, and relationships in support of the new features coming online. The goal is to keep the schema flexible and scalable, matching the growing functionality of our system.

Sprint 1: Foundational Setup
Key Tables

tickets
id (PK): Unique ticket identifier.
email: Email address of ticket creator
Category: Category of ticket (e.g., "billing", "technical support", "feature request", "general inquiry")
created_at: Timestamp when the ticket was created.
updated_at: Timestamp when the ticket was last updated.
status: Basic status (e.g., “open,” “pending,” “resolved”).
priority: Priority level (e.g., “low,” “medium,” “high”).
title: Short title or subject.
description: Initial description of the issue/request.
tags: Array or list of tags (e.g., JSONB in Postgres).
custom_fields (JSONB): Key-value pairs for additional custom data.

ticket_history
id (PK): Unique identifier for the history record.
ticket_id (FK -> tickets.id): References the ticket.
changed_by: (If already known) user or system that made the change.
changes (JSONB): Captures which fields changed (e.g., old value, new value).
created_at: Timestamp of when this history entry was created.

schema_definitions
id (PK)
field_name: Name of the custom or core field.
field_type: Data type (e.g., text, number, date).
is_required: Boolean flag for whether it’s required.
created_at, updated_at

audit_logs
id (PK)
action_type: (e.g., “SCHEMA_UPDATE”, “TICKET_CREATE”, “TICKET_UPDATE”)
action_details (JSONB): Any additional context (e.g., which fields were altered).
performed_by: Admin or system actor.
created_at: Timestamp of the logged action.
Rationale / UI Impact (Basic “Data Management” Admin Panel)
The tickets table is the central store for all tickets.
The schema_definitions table and UI help an admin add or modify custom fields.
ticket_history and audit_logs ensure changes are tracked.

Sprint 2: API Foundation
We extend the schema to handle API keys, webhooks, and integration logs.

New/Updated Tables

api_keys
id (PK)
key_value: The actual API key (hashed for security, or stored encrypted).
description: Short label for what this key is used for.
permissions (JSONB): Granular permission definitions (e.g., “read_tickets,” “create_tickets”).
created_at, updated_at

webhooks
id (PK)
url: Endpoint to call when an event is triggered.
event_types (array or JSONB): Types of events it subscribes to (e.g., “TICKET_CREATED,” “TICKET_UPDATED”).
secret: Secret token for signing payloads (optional).
is_active: Whether this webhook is currently enabled.
created_at, updated_at

api_logs
id (PK)
api_key_id (FK -> api_keys.id)
endpoint_accessed: Which API endpoint was called.
request_payload (JSONB): Request details (optional for auditing).
response_code: HTTP status code.
created_at
Rationale / UI Impact
Developer / Integration Settings pages: list, generate, and revoke API keys.
Manage webhook subscriptions and view logs to confirm they fire successfully.
api_logs can power a simple “API Usage” or “Recent Calls” dashboard.

Sprint 3: Employee Experience
We need to support agent/employee records, plus storing macros/templates and performance stats.

New/Updated Tables

employees
id (PK)
name: Full name of the employee/agent.
email: Unique email used for login/auth.
role: Basic role classification (e.g., “agent,” “admin,” “supervisor”).
created_at, updated_at

ticket_assignments
id (PK)
ticket_id (FK -> tickets.id)
employee_id (FK -> employees.id)
assigned_at: Timestamp of assignment.
unassigned_at: (nullable) If an agent was removed from the ticket or if the assignment ended.

ticket_messages
id (PK)
ticket_id (FK -> tickets.id)
sender_id: Could be an employee ID or a customer ID (if we store customers).
sender_type: (e.g., “employee,” “customer,” or “system”).
message_body (text): The content of the reply.
is_internal: Flag for internal notes vs. public response.
created_at

macros_templates
id (PK)
title: Name of the template (e.g., “Refund Policy Response”).
content (text): The reusable text.
owner_id (FK -> employees.id) (optional): If only specific user/team can manage or edit.
shared (boolean): If true, it’s usable by all agents.
created_at, updated_at
employee_metrics (optional or can be computed from existing data)

This can be either a real table or a materialized view that aggregates data from tickets.
employee_id (FK -> employees.id)
avg_response_time
avg_resolution_time
tickets_closed_count
last_calculated_at
Rationale / UI Impact
employees is needed for agent logins and references in tickets.
ticket_assignments can track which agent(s) is responsible for each ticket over time.
ticket_messages powers the conversation thread.
macros_templates backs the “Quick Responses” or “Template” feature.
employee_metrics can feed an agent’s personal performance dashboard.

Sprint 4: Administration & Routing
Now we introduce teams, routing rules, and advanced assignment logic.

New/Updated Tables

teams
id (PK)
name: e.g., “Billing Support,” “Technical Support,” “Sales,” etc.
description (optional)
created_at, updated_at

employee_teams (to handle many-to-many between employees and teams)
id (PK)
employee_id (FK -> employees.id)
team_id (FK -> teams.id)
role_in_team (optional, e.g., “team_lead,” “agent”)
created_at

routing_rules
id (PK)
rule_name
criteria (JSONB): e.g., “if ticket.tags contains ‘billing’ then route to team ‘Billing Support’.”
action (JSONB): Defines the outcome (assign to team/agent).
priority: Integer or numeric to order rule evaluation.
created_at, updated_at

skillsets
id (PK)
employee_id (FK -> employees.id)
skill_name: e.g., “Billing,” “Technical,” “Spanish Language,” etc.
skill_level: numeric rating (1-10 or 0-100).
(Alternatively, you could store skill data in employee_teams or add a JSON column in employees, depending on your design. This table approach is more granular.)

Rationale / UI Impact
teams and employee_teams let admins group agents for coverage scheduling and reporting.
routing_rules define how tickets get auto-assigned or escalated.
skillsets can inform more advanced assignment logic (matching ticket type/language to agent skill).

Sprint 5: Customer-Facing Features
We introduce customer accounts, knowledge base (KB) content, and feedback components.

New/Updated Tables

customers
id (PK)
name: Full name.
email: Email address (unique).
password_hash (or external auth token).
created_at, updated_at

kb_articles
id (PK)
title
content (text/markdown)
tags: Array or JSONB for categories.
created_at, updated_at
created_by (FK -> employees.id) or store system actor if done by an automated script.

feedback
id (PK)
ticket_id (FK -> tickets.id)
customer_id (FK -> customers.id)
rating: e.g., 1–5 or thumbs up/down.
comments: free-text area for more detail.
created_at
(Depending on your approach, you may store knowledge base in a separate system or keep it within this main DB.)

Rationale / UI Impact
The Customer Portal uses customers for secure login, plus a simplified subset of tickets data.
kb_articles feeds the Knowledge Base front-end or AI chat responses.
feedback tracks user satisfaction, connected to each ticket or agent performance.

Sprint 6: System Optimization
We focus on performance monitoring, caching, and more robust data storage.

New/Updated Tables / Views

performance_metrics (could be logs or aggregated stats)
id (PK)
metric_name: e.g., “cache_hit_rate,” “average_db_query_time”
value: numeric or JSONB for complex metrics
timestamp: When it was measured

storage_archives
id (PK)
ticket_id (FK -> tickets.id) or references to other data.
archived_data (JSONB): Full snapshot of the archived record.
archived_at
Possibly a reason or retention_period field.
index_optimizations / materialized_views

In Postgres, we might create materialized views for frequent reporting queries (e.g., employee_performance_mv).
We track these in a meta-table or simply rely on the DB structure.
Rationale / UI Impact
performance_metrics can drive an admin “System Health” dashboard.
storage_archives ensures old tickets or data are stored cost-effectively and can be retrieved on demand.
materialized_views / index_optimizations accelerate queries for dashboards and analytics.
Putting It All Together
Sprint 1: Minimal schema for tickets, custom fields, and auditing.
Sprint 2: API integration tables for keys, webhooks, logs.
Sprint 3: Agent/Employee tables, ticket assignment, internal notes (ticket_messages), and macros.
Sprint 4: Teams, skillsets, and routing rule definitions.
Sprint 5: Customer accounts, knowledge base articles, and feedback.
Sprint 6: Performance metrics, archival strategies, and caching/index enhancements.
As you wireframe each sprint’s UI panels, you’ll see how these tables power the features. The schema expansions are modular so that you can quickly adapt or extend them if new requirements appear. This approach keeps the data layer flexible while ensuring each sprint’s needs are covered.
